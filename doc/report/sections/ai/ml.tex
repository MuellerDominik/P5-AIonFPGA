As previously mentioned, machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that essentially aims to give computers the ability to learn from data.
The best results are achieved by using deep learning architectures in combination with large datasets.

There exist different types of learning such as supervised and unsupervised learning.

\paragraph{Supervised Learning}
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to learn.
The algorithm takes a guess on a piece of data from the dataset and this guess is then checked against the label (i.e. the correct answer).
This enables the algorithm to adjust itself and therefore to make it guess better.

\paragraph{Unsupervised Learning}
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and thus only operates with the input data.
The algorithm must learn to make sense of the input data, as it has no means of correcting itself.
Unsupervised learning is usually used in problems that involve finding groups in data or summarizing the distribution of data.
The majority of all data is not labeled and therefore the potential of unsupervised learning is enourmous.
The improvement of unsupervised learning is essential for the future of artificial intelligence.
