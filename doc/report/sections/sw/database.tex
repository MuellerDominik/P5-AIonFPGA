% why using a DB, since the picture names contain all the info already (easy of use in scripts)
% MySQL DB description with column names and data types

All images contain their respective labels in the file name.
% This is useful when manually looking through them but not optimal for a program.
This is useful for manually going through them, but not optimal for a program.
% The program would have to list all files and crawl through the file names.
The program would have to crawl the directory containing the images and parse the file names.
% This requires operations that involve the file system which are usually very slow.
This requires file system related operations, which are usually very slow.
The solution is to use a database that is designed to read and write such data.
% For this reason, a \textit{MySQL} database is used to store the labels and the file names.
For this reason, a MySQL database is used to store the labels, file names and other metadata.
