\subsection{Throw Detection Mechanism}
\label{subsec:throw_detection_mechanism}

To reliably detect a throw, a simple image change detection algorithm is implemented.
It requires a repeated difference computation and therefore a circular buffer is used.

% This section explains the algorithm with its required components and the saving of the images.
This section explains the algorithm, its implementation and the saving of the images.
