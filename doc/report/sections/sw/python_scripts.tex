\subsection{Python Scripts}
\label{subsec:python_scripts}

This sections lists the various Python scripts and describes their functionality.
Furthermore, it describes the created \textit{Data Acquisition and Alteration} (DAA) Python module.

Collecting and working with a large dataset is not trivial.
It requires a lot of repetitive tasks, such as moving files around and changing file names.
This is very error-prone when performed manually.
To minimize errors, the Python scripts listed in table \ref{tab:python_scripts} were used.
\\

\paragraph{DAA Python Module}
The different Python scripts require a lot of similar functionality (e.g. database connectivity, printing to the console and handling user input).
For this reason the DAA Python module --- containing settings and definitions (functions) --- was created.
The use of classes did not prove to be beneficial.
Virtually all methods would have to be declared as static methods and therefore regular functions were used.

  \begin{tabular}{lp{9cm}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{File Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_daa.py} & This Python script is used to collect the dataset. It runs the \texttt{camera-interface} binary and provides the ability to directly label the frames after each throw. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_review\_labels.py} & Even when using Python scripts, the labels have to be selected from a list and human errors might occur. This Python script is used to review the label of each throw and change it, if necessary. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_partial\_frames.py} & This Python script is used to go over each throw and to assist the labeling of frames where the object is only partially visible. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_stats.py} & During data collection and in the end, it is advantageous to keep an eye on the statistics. This is exactly what this Python script does. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_db\_backup.py} & This Python script exports all rows of the database table \texttt{aionfpga.frames} and saves them to a \texttt{.csv} file. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_fix\_frameid.py} & Due to different ways of listing files between Windows and the \texttt{os} Python module, the frames were labeled in the wrong order. This Python script is used to undo the complicated transformation. \\
