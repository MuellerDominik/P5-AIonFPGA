% creation of the data acquisition and alteration (daa) module with settings and definitions (functions)
% short summary of the function of each python script

This sections lists the various Python scripts and describes their functionality.
Furthermore, it describes the created \textit{Data Acquisition and Alteration} (DAA) Python module.

Collecting and working with a large dataset is not trivial.
% It requires a lot of repetitive taskt, such as moving the files around and chaning the file names.
It requires a lot of repetitive taskt, such as moving files around and chaning file names.
This is very error-prone when performed manually.
To minimize errors, the Python scripts listed in table \ref{tab:python_scripts} werde used.
\\

\paragraph{DAA Python Module}
The different Python scripts require a lot of similar functionality (e.g. database connectivity, printing to the console and handling user input).
For this reason the DAA Python module --- containing settings and definitions (functions) --- was created.
% It contains setting and definitions (functions).
% The usage of classes would not have proven useful
The use of classes did not prove to be beneficial.
Virtually all methods would have to be declared as static methods and therefore regular functions were used.
% Therefore, regular functions were used.

    \toprule
    \textbf{File Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_daa.py} & This Python script is used to collect the dataset. It runs the \texttt{camera-interface} binary and provides the ability to directly label the frames after each throw. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_review\_labels.py} & Even when using Python scripts, the labels have to be selected from a list and human errors might occur. This Python script is used to review the label of each throw and change it, if necessary. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_partial\_frames.py} & This Python script is used to go over each throw and to assist the labeling of frames where the object is only partially visible. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_stats.py} & During data collection and in the end, it is advantageous to keep an eye on the statistics. This is exactly what this Python script does. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_db\_backup.py} & This Python script exports all rows of the database table \texttt{aionfpga.frames} and saves them to a \texttt{.csv} file. \\
    \midrule
    \texttt{aionfpga\_fix\_frameid.py} & Due to different ways of listing files between Windows and the \texttt{os} Python module, the frames were labeled in the wrong order. This Python script is used to undo the complicated transformation. \\
