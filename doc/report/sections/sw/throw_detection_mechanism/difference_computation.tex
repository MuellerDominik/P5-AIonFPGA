\subsubsection{Difference Computation}
\label{subsubsec:difference_computation}
% \todo[inline]{Citations, Picture of how the diff. is calculated or matrices?}

% computation of the difference how it is done with opencv

% done for every frame except the first one (FID = 0)

% after the threshold averaging (see chapter threshold) ?!

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C++]
  cv::absdiff(cv_buffer[frame_id % buff_size], cv_buffer[(frame_id - 1) % buff_size], cv_abs);
  mean_diff = cv::sum(cv_abs)[0] / (width * height);
\end{lstlisting}
