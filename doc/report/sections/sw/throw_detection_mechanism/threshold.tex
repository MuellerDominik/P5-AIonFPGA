% how is the Threshold Value Determination done:
% average difference to obtain threshold (with pictures)
  % => 50 Hz flicker reduction

Ideally, the mean absolute difference between two consecutive unchanged frames is zero.
% However, due to image noise and other environmental influences such as \SI{50}{Hz} flickering of the ambient light intensity, this is not the case.
This is not the case, however, due to image noise and other environmental influences such as \SI{50}{Hz} flickering of the ambient light intensity.
A suitable threshold value must therefore be determined.
% For this purpose, the first eight mean absolute differences $\overline{\text{MD}}$ are averaged to determine the threshold value.
For this purpose, the first eight mean absolute differences $\overline{\text{MD}}$ are averaged to determine the threshold value.
At a frame rate of \SI{200}{fps} this results in a short start-up delay of \SI{40}{ms}.
