\subsubsection{Threshold Value Determination}
\label{subsubsec:threshold}

Ideally, the mean absolute difference between two consecutive unchanged frames is zero.
This is not the case, however, due to image noise and other environmental influences such as \SI{50}{Hz} flickering of the ambient light intensity.
A suitable threshold value must therefore be determined.
For this purpose, the first eight mean absolute differences $\overline{\text{MD}}$ are used to determine the threshold value.
They are averaged and multiplied by a multiplier, as show in figure \ref{fig:threshold}.
At a frame rate of \SI{200}{fps} this results in a short start-up delay of \SI{40}{ms}.
