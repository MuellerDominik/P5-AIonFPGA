% \todo[inline]{Citations}

% opencv matrix circular buffer (same size as Baumer buffer but shallow [shallow-copy])
  % only pointer to the baumer pixel data
  % copying would require a lot of space and time (which is not much to play with), thus main reason time
% circular buffer graphic

\begin{lstlisting}[style=C++]
  cv_buffer[frame_id % buff_size] = cv::Mat(height, width, CV_8UC1, (void *) pBufferFilled->GetMemPtr());
\end{lstlisting}
