\todo[inline]{Citations, List of available classes with description}

The Baumer GAPI provides main classes that represent the logical and physical components of the image processing system.
Furthermore, it provides list classes to enable discovery and listing of the main objects.
There are even some additional classes to transform images and for debugging.
All classes are available through the namespace \texttt{BGAPI2} after including the header file \texttt{bgapi2\_genicam.hpp}.
