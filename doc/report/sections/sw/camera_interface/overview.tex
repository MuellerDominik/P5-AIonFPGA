The Baumer GAPI is based on the Generic Interface for Cameras (GenICam).
It is a package of several libraries and the GenICam Producers (e.g. \texttt{bgapi2\_usb.cti}).
It provides the main classes that represent the logical and physical components of the image processing system.
Furthermore, it provides list classes to enable discovery and listing of the main objects.
There are even some additional classes to transform images and for debugging.
All classes are available through the namespace \texttt{BGAPI2} after including the header file \texttt{bgapi2\_genicam.hpp}.

    \textbf{Main Classes} & \textbf{List Classes} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
     & \textbf{\texttt{SystemList}} & The class \texttt{SystemList} is used to discover objects of the class \texttt{System} (Producer). \\

    \textbf{\texttt{System}} & \textbf{\texttt{InterfaceList}} & The class \texttt{System} is the abstraction of the Producer and used to discover objects of the class \texttt{Interface}. \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{\texttt{Interface}} & \textbf{\texttt{DeviceList}} & The class \texttt{Interface} represents a physical interface (e.g. USB) and can be used to discover objects of the class \texttt{Device}. \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{\texttt{Device}} & \textbf{\texttt{DataStream}} & The class \texttt{Device} is used to configure the camera and can also be used to discover objects of the class \texttt{DataStream}. \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{\texttt{DataStream}} & \textbf{\texttt{BufferList}} & The class \texttt{DataStream} represents a data stream from the camera to the host and can be used to list objects of the class \texttt{Buffer}. \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{\texttt{Buffer}} &  & The \texttt{Buffer} class represents a single memory buffer and acts as the target for the image acquisition. \\
