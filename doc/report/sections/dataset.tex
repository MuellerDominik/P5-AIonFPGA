% first day white balance problem => DONE
% weniger bilder am rand von kleinen objekten, aufgrund des bildÃ¤nderungsalgorithmuses (siehe kapitel ...) => done
% all the different objects => table done
% some pictures to illustrate something => done, illustrate what?
% stats (from python file)

% ref to picture of lamp brightness distribution (camera / lighting) => done

The dataset contains images of 22 different throwing objects, as shown in table \ref{tab:objects}.
% The collected dataset is fully labeled and contains more than \num{15000} usable images.
It is fully labeled and consists of more than \num{15000} usable images with at least 480 images of each object.
% There are 22 different throwing objects, as shown in table \ref{tab:objects}.
% Table \ref{tab:objects} lists the 22 \num{22} different throwing objects.
% The dataset contains at least 480 images of each object.
All images were collected over the cource of two days.
Figure \ref{subfig:stuffed_bunny} shows an example image of the \textit{Stuffed Bunny} and figure \ref{subfig:hand_featherball} shows an image of the \textit{Hand Featherball}.

Figure \ref{fig:statistics} shows the statistics.
It is evident that there are generally more images of larger objects.
% darker areas on the edges => LESS image change rate
% One reason for this, is the implemented throw detection mechanism (see section \ref{subsec:throw_detection_mechanism}).
% This is partly due to the implemented throw detection mechanism (see section \ref{subsec:throw_detection_mechanism}).
This is, on the one hand, due to the specific implementation of the throw detection mechanism (see section \ref{subsec:throw_detection_mechanism}).
% The field of view is not uniformly illuminated, as described in section \ref{subsec:Lighting}.
On the other hand, the field of view is not uniformly illuminated, as described in section \ref{subsec:Lighting}.
% For this reason, a larger area is needed to achieve a sufficiently high image change.
For those reason, a larger object area is required at the borders to achieve a sufficiently large change in the image.
However, this also leads to the fact that the larger objects are more often only partially in the picture.

An important thing is that, on the first day, the white balance was performed continuously (every three images).
This caused the background color of large colored objects to be distorted.
% The labels include a Unix timestamp.
It remains to be seen whether this will become a problem during training.
% However, it is easy to remove these images should they become a problem if the label contains a Unix timestamp.
However, if this should become a problem, the respective images can easily be removed, as the labels contain a Unix timestamp (see section \ref{subsec:database}).
