\section{Artificial Intelligence}
\label{sec:ai}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the simulation of intelligent behaviour in computers.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI and deals with the study of algorithms that computers use to perform certain tasks without using explicit instructions.
Deep learning is a family of machine learning methods which are based on artificial neural networks (ANNs).
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific deep learning architecture that is primarily used for image classification \cite{ai_machine_learning}.

This chapter provides a brief overview of ML and a short introduction to CNNs.
