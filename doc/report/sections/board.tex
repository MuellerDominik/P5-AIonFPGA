The hardware is an Ultra96-V2 board, which is distributed by Avnet.
The MPSoC installed on it is a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZU3EG A484.
This chip is from the Zynq UltraScale+ family and has an UltraScale architecture.
Integrated is a Quad-core ARM Cortex A53 processor to run a complete operating system and a Dual-core ARM Cortex R5, which makes the Ultra96-V2 hard realtime capable.
The A53 core can be clocked with 1.5GHz, the R5 with 600MHz.

The chip also has 154k logic cells and 141k flip flops \cite{XilinxZynq}.
These allow a hardware acceleration of up to a factor of 20 compared to the fastest CPUs \cite{AccelerationXilinx}.
Xilinx therefore recommends the board as ideal for the field of artificial intelligence \cite{AIResourcesXilinx}.

The Ultra96-V2 also features 2GB LPDDR4 RAM from Micron and two USB 3.0 ports, which are essential for fast image processing.
A mini DisplayPort serves as connection to a monitor \cite{AvnetUltra96v2}. This guarantees a standalone operation.
