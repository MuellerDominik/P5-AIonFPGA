Collecting a sufficiently large dataset of pictures is not trivial.
% Why is it not trivial?
When done manually, the camera has to be started and stopped for each throw.
This likely creates many empty frames at the beginning and at the end of the capture.
Those empty and therefore invalid frames must be removed to avoid errors during the training of the CNN later on.
Furthermore, each valid frame must be labeled.
This procedure is very error-prone if it is performed manually for each individual frame.
% Solution
To simplify this task, a camera throw detection mechanism is implemented and various Python scripts are used.

This chapter desrcibes the camera interface, the implemented throw detection mechanism, the used database and the various Python scripts.
