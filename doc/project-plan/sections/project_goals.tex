\section{Project Goal}
\label{sec:project_goal}
The goal of project 5 and the thesis is to create an eye-catcher which demonstrates the engineering competences in FPGA and AI based design of the institute for sensors and electronics (ISE). To achieve this, a throwing booth consiting of a camera, an FPGA development board and a monitor will be designed. Throwing objects can then be captured by the camera, classified on the FPGA by a CNN model and displayed on the monitor.

The respective objectives for project 5 and the thesis are specified in the sections below.
