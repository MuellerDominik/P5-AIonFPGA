During the thesis, all further steps will be taken to reach the goal of the project. Specifically, the following objectives will be achieved:

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{L{1cm}|L{4cm}|X}
		\textbf{No.}	& \textbf{Objective}				& \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		1.				& CNN Model							& The CNN model is developed and trained in Python 3 using TensorFlow 2 and the images collected in project 5. \\ \hline
		2.				& High-Performance Implementation	& The advantages of an FPGA flow into the development. Thus, special attention is paid to the performance of the system. \\ \hline
		3.				& Display							& A monitor displays the image of the object that was thrown. Furthermore, the guess of the CNN is shown. \\ \hline
		4.				& Verification						& The accuracy of the CNN model implemented on the FPGA is verified.
