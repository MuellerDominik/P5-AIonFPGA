\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{L{1cm}|L{4cm}|X}
		\textbf{No.}	& \textbf{Objective}			& \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		1.				& Throwing Booth				& A throwing booth consisting of a camera, an FPGA development board, a monitor, throwing objects and proper lighting is set up. \\ \hline
		2.				& DNNDK Toolchain				& The Xilinx DNNDK toolchain is understood to the extent that no further research is necessary during the thesis. \\ \hline
		3.				& Object Detection				& A trigger mechanism detects when an object is in front of the camera. \\ \hline
		4.				& Data Collection				& A labeled dataset is created (quality and quantity is sufficient to train the convolutional neural network). \\ \hline
		5.				& AI on FPGA					& The functional capability to detect objects using AI of the Ultra96-V2 is demonstrated (e.g. Traffic Sign Detection). \\ \hline
		6.				& Data Collection Application	& An application which simplifies the creation of a labeled dataset is developed.
